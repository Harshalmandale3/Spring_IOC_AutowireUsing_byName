# Spring IOC Autowire Using byName

The Spring IOC Autowire byName allows the spring container to inject a property or bean as a dependency based on the property name of the bean. When autowiring byName, the spring container will look for a bean in the application context whose name matches the name of the property that is being autowired.<br>

Autowiring byName is especially useful when working with large applications that have many beans, as it allows the spring container to manage the dependency injection without having to explicitly specify the bean that should be injected into the property.
